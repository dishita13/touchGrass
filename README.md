## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Analyze Existing Apps:
    Venmo: 
        - Seeing what my friends are up to 
        - Feeling that transactions are safe and secure 
    Libby:
        - That books are available to read offline
        - Very simple and intuitive UI 
    Spotify:
        - Receiving algorithmically generated music recommendations 
        - Being able to personalize playlist covers and profiles
        
## App Idea 
I would like to build an app called TouchGrass that helps users limit their screen time usage by having an accountability partner. I would use the ScreenTime API to see that if a user has passed their screen time goals then their partner can nudge them. The accountability partner and primary are working together to hit screen time weekly or monthly goals together. 
User Stories:
     - As a user, I would like to log into my app to store my ScreenTime data
     - As a user, I would like to match with another user over iMessage to be accountability partners
     - As a user, I would like to set goals based on my screen time
     - As a user, I would like to receive daily progress checks to see if I am on track 
     - As a user, I would like to only share my total screen time with my friend and choose what summary data I share with them. 

## Notes

Initially I had created a new multiplatform project instead of an iOS project which had various different settings than what I expected for iOS. Once I resolved that it was a good learning experience to familiarize myself with the iOS and XCode tools.
